# KartPad Personal IPA Builder

KartPad uses static recompilation. A playable app therefore has to translate
the supported game executable on the user's Mac before Apple signing. The
public Builder automates that local process; it is not an emulator, does not
download game data, and does not make one universal playable IPA.

## Current preview

The first Builder preview supports one verified input: the pinned PAL
`RMCP01` revision 0 WBFS development image. It produces an unsigned,
personalized IPA for local signing. The Builder and compatibility metadata are
public; disc data, extracted files, translated code, signing material, and the
resulting IPA remain ignored and private.

Requirements are an Apple Silicon Mac, Xcode, CMake, Ninja, Git, ripgrep,
Python 3, .NET 8, and `nodtool` 2.0.0-alpha.9. Fetch the profile's exact pinned
source checkouts and hash-verified physical-iOS Dawn archive once:

```sh
./scripts/build-user-ipa.sh bootstrap
./scripts/build-user-ipa.sh doctor
```

The bootstrap fetches only dependencies declared by the selected profile,
checks out exact commits, initializes their submodules, disables push URLs,
and fails rather than modifying an unexpected or dirty existing checkout.

Inspect an image without extracting it:

```sh
./scripts/build-user-ipa.sh inspect /path/to/Mario-Kart-Wii.wbfs
```

Build the private unsigned IPA:

```sh
./scripts/build-user-ipa.sh build /path/to/Mario-Kart-Wii.wbfs
```

The default output is ignored at
`artifacts/KartPad-personal-unsigned.ipa`. Do not upload or redistribute that
file: it contains translated code generated from the user's game executable.

## Compatibility profiles

Profiles live in `builder/profiles/` and are versioned JSON. They keep these
concerns separate:

- accepted container formats and exact full-image hashes;
- disc ID, disc number, revision, and Wii magic;
- extracted DOL and REL identities;
- load addresses, memory layout, entry points, function map, injectors, and
  expected translation counts.

This design allows multiple verified WBFS/ISO container variants to point to
one static-recompilation profile when extraction proves they contain the same
DOL and REL. A different region or executable revision receives a separate
profile because addresses and generated code can change. Unknown inputs always
fail closed.

To add compatibility:

1. Verify the complete image and extract it read-only.
2. Record the container SHA-256 only after establishing legal provenance.
3. Compare the extracted DOL/REL hashes and disc header with an existing
   profile.
4. Add a container entry only if the executable identities are identical;
   otherwise create and validate a new profile.
5. Run `./scripts/test-kartpad-builder.sh` and a complete local build twice.

## Repeatable builds and cache safety

Validated extraction is cached by profile and complete input-image hash, so
ordinary code changes do not extract the same disc again. Build and translation
workspaces use a stricter key containing the input-image hash, canonical
profile hash, Builder pipeline version, tracked source index, and current source
diff. A code or profile change therefore cannot silently reuse an older app
workspace. Extraction and translation stages validate their manifests before
reuse and stage new extraction atomically. IPA ZIP entries are sorted, have fixed
timestamps, and preserve executable permissions, so the same audited app and
provenance produce byte-identical packages.

The IPA embeds a content-safe `KartPadBuilderProvenance.json` containing hashes
and profile identifiers, never local source paths. Packaging rejects disc
images, saves, provisioning profiles, signatures, and explicitly supplied
private path prefixes.

## Release boundary

Only the Builder source, profiles, tests, and documentation may be attached to
a public release. Never publish a generated translation directory, app bundle,
personal IPA, extracted game tree, save, signing certificate, or provisioning
profile.

Online multiplayer is almost complete but still pending end-to-end testing.
That work is independent of Builder compatibility and is not claimed as
working in this preview.
