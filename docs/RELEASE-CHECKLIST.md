# KartPad release checklist

## tvOS experimental candidate

- [x] Publish the physically untested artifact only as an explicit hardware-
      bring-up preview and direct initial testing to a small Apple TV cohort
      using [`docs/TVOS-TESTING.md`](TVOS-TESTING.md) and the acceptance matrix
      in [`docs/TVOS.md`](TVOS.md).
- [x] Label that artifact experimental and unaccepted until tester evidence
      completes the physical Apple TV matrix.
- [ ] Prove Original and Retro Rewind gameplay separately with an Extended
      Gamepad; do not infer Retro WFC acceptance from offline play.
- [ ] Back up and rehearse restore of Caches/KartPad before asking a
      tester to risk saved progress.
- [ ] Re-audit the exact signed tester artifact for private game data, Retro
      Rewind content, derived game artwork, signing material, and local paths.

The exact 67-row matrix in `docs/PRD.md` remains the authority for full
engineering completion. A community preview may ship with narrower, explicit
limitations when its exact artifact passes every preview gate below.

- [x] Reassert the persistent three-dot button after an iPadOS screenshot
